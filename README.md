# Summer Chores Callback Simulation

This project is a fun JavaScript simulation that demonstrates how to use **asynchronous callbacks** to handle a sequence of tasks (or "chores") for a fictional character. The goal is to show how one chore triggers the next **only if the previous one was successfully completed**, mimicking real-world dependencies and energy levels as the character has a higher probability to get tired as they complete more chores.

## ðŸ›  Project Summary

The script simulates a person (e.g., "Billy") attempting to complete a list of summer chores:

1. Mow the lawn
2. Use the weed eater
3. Trim the hedges
4. Collect wood
5. Water the garden

Each chore is:
- Simulated with a `setTimeout()` to introduce delay
- Conditioned on the person's **energy level**, using a probabilistic `useEnergy()` function
- Connected to the next chore via **callbacks**

If the person "runs out of energy" (i.e. `useEnergy()` returns false), they "fall asleep" and stop working.

This project is intentionally written in a **callback-based style** to illustrate "callback hell" and the importance of control flow in asynchronous JavaScript.
